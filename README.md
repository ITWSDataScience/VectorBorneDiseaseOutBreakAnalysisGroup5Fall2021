### Abstract
This project is on CCHF, also known as Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever, a vector-borne disease. Using climate data including humidity, precipitation, and temperature, in conjunction with data on location and the number of cases, we hope to get a better understanding of the types of environments that facilitate the spread of CCHF. To do this, we gathered data specific to the South Asian countries of Oman, Saudi Arabia, and UAE — countries endemic for CCHF, and countries of Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and Yemen — countries non-endemic for CCHF. The goal of this project is to see whether or not there are specific climate variables in endemic countries, and to provide broad overview of the types of climate that may lead to other countries potentially becoming endemic for CCHF given climate change. For the datasets, we obtained the data using Ethan Joseph’s script and Visual Crossing.
